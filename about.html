              2 For the existentialists, a paradox lies at the heart of the
              novel. As a work of art, the novel exists as a given totality. At
              the same time, the capacity of the novel to compel belief in the
              free and independent existence of its characters depends on the

              reframing of foundational debates in novel theory takes us beyond
              old dichotomies of mind and world, interiority and totality, and
              form and mimesis. It illuminates existential dimensions of
              novelistic realism overlooked by empirical and sociological
              approaches.
